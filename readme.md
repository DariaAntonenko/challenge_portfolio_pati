# Task 1: software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hello. My name is Dasha Antonenko. For a long time I dreamed of changing the profession and becoming a part of IT.But it turned out that I always needed money and I thought how to earn now no later. There was no always time for myself and i thought how to give the best to my child.There was a time  when i sat on maternity leave and counted how much coffee I could drink per day.When the child was 3 month old I already found a job and started workinf at hone and after 6 month I went to full-time work and worked in sales. I didnt want to be a merchandiser and set myself the goal of growing and at the age of 28 I got a position of supervisor of the Vip department. Considering the curent situotin in my country I made a conclusion that the future perspective in this company is very weak and I  realised That it is a time to change my life and start learning another profession and do what you have dreamed of for a long time. I have completed the courses of a manual tester and now I want to get an internship in a company in order to get a job. The desire to develop in the profession, the ability to motivate myself,to learn quickly - i hope these will help to achieve my goal.
### Thanks
#### Dasha
